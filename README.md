# suicuneFinder

this is a java program that allows you to automatically soft reset your Pokemon Crystal game to look for a shiny suicune

# COMPATIBILITY

> * on the 1.1 release we have big news! i finally support windows on 1080p and 720p! you can even adjust it for your custom screen resolution, BUT I'M NOT SURE IF IT WORKS
>
> * macOS is only supported at 1280x800 right now
>
> this is only compatible with visualboyadvance-m

# HOW TO USE

1) you have to change you VBA input settings [Options > Input > Configure] as shown here [https://imgur.com/a/jNIE2VO], set [Options > Speedup / Turbo] to 250% (if you want more you have to change the timings in the mac.java file), then turn on [Emulation > Turbo mode]
2) when runned, the program will open the CMD + TAB menu: select VBA (you have to run it on full screen)
3) wait! it's gonna take a while, it's 1/8192 chance!
4) done! it will stop resetting and it will tell you how many resets it has done to find it. Good Luck :D


# future updates

now since i am having fun coding this software, i am continuing to update it, if you encounter any bug, want to leave a feedback or maybe suggest something, my discord is L3Ap#6751, DM me there
right now i'm currently working on supporting more screen sizes on macOS, but i will shortly start working on supporting the catch of different pokemons, like the Jhoto starters and other legendaries, so stay tuned :3
