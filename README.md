# HOW TO USE

1) you have to change you VBA input settings [Options > Input > Configure] as shown here [https://imgur.com/a/jNIE2VO], set [Options > Speedup / Turbo] to 250% (if you want more you have to change the timings in the mac.java file), then turn on [Emulation > Turbo mode]

3) when runned, the program will open the CMD + TAB menu: select VBA (you have to run it on full screen)
4) wait! it's gonna take a while, it's 1/8192 chance!
5) done! it will stop resetting and it will tell you how many resets it has done to find it. Good Luck :D
